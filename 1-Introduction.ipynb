    "Hi everyone! My name is Erick Ratamero, and I am a Systems Analyst at the Research IT department at the Jackson Laboratory, a research non-profit based in Bar Harbor, Maine, United States. Our group is called Imaging Solutions, and we provide hardware and software support for 70+ PIs and their groups on all their needs when it comes to imaging data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, thanks for the interest in this workshop! I will go through a very short presentation about ezomero, describing what it is and how it works, and then I will show you some concrete examples of ezomero in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not gone through our setup guide, now is a good time to pause this video and do so! We encourage everyone to follow along the workshop by actually writing the commands I will be showing and seeing their results on your own computer. To do that, you will need a Python environment with ezomero and access to an OMERO server. The setup guide goes into detail on how to get those things together.\n",

    "(presentation goes here)\n",
    "\n",
    "So before we start the actual workshop, I will go through a very simple example on how to retrieve an image from an OMERO server using omero-py and ezomero, just as a warm-up and a point of comparison. This is just a teaser for the things we'll be doing, and just to show that it's real easy to do with the scaffolding we've built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the two APIs we will show here, OMERO has a CLI interface that can do a lot of stuff - (almost?) all of it can also be done with the omero-py API, so it would be kinda redundant. But it's useful if you just want to write a bash script to automate something.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first things first, I'm using a `config.py` file containing all the sensitive info here. In general I have this as a local file that won't be on the github repository, I make sure I have it accessible only for my system user and don't keep it saved between sessions (or at least keep it saved without the password). In this case I'm using a default user on a local server, so no reason not to show you. If you are using the docker-compose from this repository as your OMERO server, you can also use the file as is, otherwise make sure to alter it to point to your own OMERO server."
